# Blog-App

This is a flutter app that allows users to create, read, update and delete blog posts. 
It uses a Appwrite backend to store the blog posts.

## Offline Support
The app uses a local database called Isar. This allows the user to read the blogs offline and sync with the Appwrite backend when the user is online.

## Device Support
The app is built for both Android and iOS devices but is only tested on Android devices.
